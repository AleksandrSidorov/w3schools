    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

        <strong>S</strong>tyle <strong>S</strong>heets</li>
      <li>CSS defines <strong>how HTML elements are to be displayed</strong></li>
      <li>Styles were added to HTML 4.0 <strong>to solve a problem</strong></li>
      <li>CSS saves a lot of work</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2>
    <p>HTML was Never intended to contain tags for formatting a document.</p>
    <p>HTML was intended to <strong>define the content</strong> of a document,
      like:</p>
    <p>&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt/h1&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p>When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML
      3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development
      of large web sites, where fonts and color information were added to every
      single page, became a long and expensive process.</p>
    <p>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
    </p>
    <p>In HTML 4.0, all formatting could (and should!) be removed from the HTML
      document, and stored in a separate CSS file.</p>
    <p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.</p>
    <p>With an external style sheet file, yoiu can change the look of an entire
      Web site by changing just one file!</p>

      <h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
    </div>

    <p>A CSS rule set consists of a selector and a declaration block:</p>
    <pre>sesector {property: value; property2: value;}</pre>
    <p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.</p>
    <p>The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by
      semicolons.
    </p>
    <p>Each declaration includes a property name and a value, separated by a
      colon.</p>

    <h2>CSS Example</h2>
    <p>A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration groups
      are surronded by curly braces:</p>
    <pre>p {color:red; text-align:center;}</pre>
    <p>To make the CSS code more readable, yoiu can put one declaration on each
      lne.</p>
    <p>In the following example all &lt;p&gt; elements will be center-aligned,
      with a red text color:</p>
    <pre>p {
    color: red;
    text-align: center;
}</pre>

    <h2>CSS Comments</h2>
    <p>Comments are used to explain your code, and may help you when you edit
      the source code at a later date. Comments are ignored by browsers.</p>
    <p>A CSS comment starts with <code>/*</code> and ends with
      <code>*/</code>. Comments can also span multiple lines:</p>
    <pre>p {
    color: red;
    /* This is a single-line comment */
    text-align: center;
}

/* This is
a multi-line
comment */
</pre>
